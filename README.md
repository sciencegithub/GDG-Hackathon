### 🧑‍💻 Teammate (Easy / Safe / Visible)

- [x] Update task
- [x] Delete task
- [ ] GET `/tasks/:id`
- [ ] GET `/users`
- [ ] GET `/users/:id`
- [ ] Tasks per user
- [ ] Pending vs completed
- [ ] Total counts
- [ ] Workload distribution
- [ ] GET `/dashboard`
- [ ] Count tasks per user
- [ ] Active tasks
- [ ] Completed tasks
- [ ] Overdue tasks

- [ ] DB → PostgreSQL
- [ ] Basic env setup
- [ ] Seeding (5 users / 20 tasks / 2 projects)
- [ ] Basic notifications
- [ ] Priority field

### 🔗 How To Work Together

- [ ] Define DTOs and APIs first
- [ ] Keep response format consistent: `{ success, data, message }`
- [ ] You own `Services/`, `Repositories/`, `Middleware/`
- [ ] Teammate owns `Controllers/`, `DTOs/`, dashboard wiring

### ⚡ Final Execution Plan

- [ ] Week 1: You handle auth, authorization, middleware; teammate handles CRUD and basic APIs
- [ ] Week 2: You handle transactions, repository, logging; teammate handles pagination and dashboard
- [ ] Week 3: You handle SignalR and AI; teammate handles deployment and seeding

## 🔥 What Makes Your Project Stand Out

### 1. Activity Log (IMPORTANT)

- [ ] Track actions:
  - [ ] task created
  - [ ] task assigned
  - [ ] status changed

### 2. Ownership Security

- [ ] User can only access their tasks

### 3. Clean API Responses

- [ ] Use DTOs
- [ ] No raw entities

---

## 🧱 Simple Architecture

- [ ] Frontend (React)
- [x] Backend (.NET API)
- [x] PostgreSQL
- [ ] Gemini API

## 🐳 Run With Docker

This project uses Docker Compose from the Backend folder. It starts the API and a PostgreSQL container together.

### 1. Go to the backend folder

```bash
cd Backend
```

### 2. Make sure `.env` exists

The backend expects these values in `Backend/.env`:

- `POSTGRES_DB`
- `POSTGRES_USER`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
- `CONNECTION_STRING`

### 3. Start the containers

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### 4. Open the API

- API: `http://localhost:5000`
- Swagger: `http://localhost:5000/swagger`

### 5. Stop the containers

```bash
docker compose down
```

If you want to remove the database volume too:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```
