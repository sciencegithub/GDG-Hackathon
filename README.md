- [ ] Repository layer
- [ ] Soft delete
- [ ] Seeding (5 users / 20 tasks / 2 projects)

### PHASE 3 (Standout)

- [ ] SignalR
  - [ ] Task status updates live
  - [ ] Assignment updates live
- [ ] AI assignment
  - [ ] Deterministic input/output
  - [ ] Return explanation
  - [ ] Fallback to least active tasks

## 🔥 What Makes Your Project Stand Out

### 1. Activity Log (IMPORTANT)

- [ ] Track actions:
  - [ ] task created
  - [ ] task assigned
  - [ ] status changed

### 2. Ownership Security

- [ ] User can only access their tasks

### 3. Clean API Responses

- [ ] Use DTOs
- [ ] No raw entities

---

## 🧱 Simple Architecture

- [ ] Frontend (React)
- [x] Backend (.NET API)
- [x] PostgreSQL
- [ ] Gemini API

---

## 🐳 Run With Docker

This project uses Docker Compose from the Backend folder. It starts the API and a PostgreSQL container together.

### 1. Go to the backend folder

```bash
cd Backend
```

### 2. Make sure `.env` exists

The backend expects these values in `Backend/.env`:

- `POSTGRES_DB`
- `POSTGRES_USER`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
- `CONNECTION_STRING`

### 3. Start the containers

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### 4. Open the API

- API: `http://localhost:5000`
- Swagger: `http://localhost:5000/swagger`

### 5. Stop the containers

```bash
docker compose down
```

If you want to remove the database volume too:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```
